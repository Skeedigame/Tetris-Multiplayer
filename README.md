<h2 align="center">Installation:</h2>
</a>
1. Extract the zip and open 'Tetris.exe'
2. If you get a warning from windows, press on the underlined text that says 'More Info' then 'Run Anyway'. It's not dangerous, Windows just can't verify the program because it's not been signed by a corporation.

<h2 align="center">Important:</h2>
After you run the exe it may appear as nothing has happened. Just wait patiently as the game is creating the
neccessary directories to run. If a extended amount of time has passed and the game still hasn't opened, run
the file again.
